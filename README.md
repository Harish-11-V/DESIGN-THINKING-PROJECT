## 🔍 Project Overview

The **GenAI Sustainability Intelligence Assistant** is an AI-driven decision support system built using **Large Language Models (LLMs)** and **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** to deliver **accurate, context-aware sustainability insights**.

The system combines the reasoning power of LLMs with a **knowledge-grounded retrieval layer**, enabling users to explore sustainability-focused technology decisions with **explainability, reliability, and real-world relevance**.

This project demonstrates how **Generative AI can be applied responsibly** to sustainability-focused problem domains through intelligent knowledge retrieval and natural language interaction.

## 🧠 Key Capabilities

- 🌍 Sustainability-focused decision intelligence  
- 🧠 Natural language interaction using LLMs  
- 🔎 Knowledge-grounded responses via RAG  
- 📚 Context-aware semantic retrieval  
- ✅ Reduced hallucinations with source-backed outputs  
- 🚀 Scalable and modular architecture  

---

## ⚙️ System Architecture

**User Query → Semantic Search → Knowledge Retrieval → LLM Reasoning → Context-Aware Response**

The assistant retrieves relevant domain information from a structured knowledge base and augments the LLM response to ensure **accuracy, relevance, and interpretability**.
